# Reproducible Science in Forestry (or any field really)

This set of workshop sessions is designed to introduce you to reproducible workflows using open source tools
We will be using `R`, `Rstudio`, `Git`, `GitHub`, and `GitHub Desktop` to write readable transferable code. We will use Rstudio to manage these projects and will employ the `TidyVerse` to clean, modify, and analyze data without the need to alter raw data files. Finally we will work on version control of a project using `Git` and `GitHub`. The ultimate goal of this workshop is to generate a *Reproducible Workflow*. The implications of which will:

* Reduce new ad-hoc errors in data analysis
* Organize research projects
* Enhance collaborations
* Ensure openness and transparency in science

We are glad you have joined us today.
