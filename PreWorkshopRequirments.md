# First things first

Before you arrive at the workshop you should download and install all of the appropriate open source programs and R packages. **just click on the blue link to go to the appropriate website**

## Open source programs needed

1. Download and install the most recent version of [R](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html)

2. Download and install [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

3. Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) Account (*it's free*)

    3.1. If you are an *undergrad/grad* student request the [GitHub educational backpack](https://education.github.com/pack)

    3.1.1. This is not necessary to be successful at the workshop; however it will provide you with unlimited private repositories on your GitHub account as well as other useful resources.  

4. Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

5. Download and install Git for [windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) or [mac](http://git-scm.com/downloads)

6. We will use Hadley Wickham's open source (Rmarkdown) book [*R for Data Science*](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) and Jennifer Bryan's [*Happy Git and GitHub for the useR*](https://happygitwithr.com/) as references in the workshop. So have a look at it before we begin the workshop

## The Tidyverse
Once `R` and `Rstudio` are installed and running install the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages
 `install.packages("tidyverse")`.
The tidyverse has a core set of packages that we will be using in our workshop including `ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purr, tibble, stringr, and forcats`.
Other libraries will be called individually from `R` as needed. The `tidyverse` is a shared grammer, and philosphy that speeds up data analysis.

## Aditional R packages needed
Open `Rstudio` and run this `code`
`install.packages("nlme")`
`install.packages("GGally")`

## Workshop Data
We will be using data collected from western white pine (*Pinus monticola*) and southwestern white pine (*Pinus strobiformis*). All data is available on the [workshop github site](https://github.com/mitramenon/IEG-workshop--Durango-MX)
