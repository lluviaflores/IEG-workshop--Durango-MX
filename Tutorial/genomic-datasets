Background:
Until recently genetic analysis to understand species ability to respond to rapid changes in climate and predict their future distribution by combining genetic and environmental data was largely limited to model organisms for which genomic information such as gene information and location were available. Recent years have seen rapid reduction in sequencing cost and the development of technology to parallelise the production of short fragments of DNA sequences. This has caused a surge in the datasets available for even non-model organisms such as conifers with large genome sizes. Population genetics studies of trees has now moved beyond single gene sequencing and SSR. The family of approach that has specifically gained popularity is RAD seq or Restriction site associated DNA sequencing. Please go over Patterson et al to understand how this technique makes use of restriction enzymes and size selection to reduce the complexity of large genomes. 
In this tutorial, we will make use of the data generated from ddRAD-seq to do the following:
a) Estimate allele frequency and obtain population level measures of genetic diversity.
b) Utilize inforation from yestarday's session to assess the interaction between genetics-phenotype-environment and test hypothesis related to local adaptation.
